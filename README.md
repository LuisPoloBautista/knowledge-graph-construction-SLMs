    <h1>knowledge graph construction SLMs</h1>
</div>

This repository shows a semi-automatic framework for generating Knowledge Graphs about earthquakes from unstructured text using Small Language Models. Through techniques to reduce hallucinations and improve semantic coherence, the approach achieves reliable and verifiable graphs, demonstrating that SLMs can extract quality knowledge in critical domains.

The proposal is divided into nine sections: 

1) Corpus Selection & Pre-Processing
2) Extraction of Named Entities and Relations
3) Post-processing
4) Hallucination Filtering
5) Semantic Similarity
6) Semantic Annotation and KG Generation
7) Experiment
